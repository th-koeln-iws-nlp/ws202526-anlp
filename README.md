# Advanced Natural Language Processing - The Road to LLMs - Winter Term 2025/26

This is the GitHub Repository for the ANLP course in the winter term 2025/26. Here, you can find all lecture slides as well as the notebooks and code examples.

## Requirements & Grading

The exam and grade consists of
- Code implementation of all discussed milestones (30%, per team)
    - Code needs to be functioning and explained via comments
- A short (max 2 pages) report (pdf format) on the implementation, results and the work done by the team members (20%, per team)
- A 10 minute oral presentation per team member on their individual work on the 15th of January 2026 (50%, individual)

The final code and report has to be ready in your team's GitHub Repo by the 16th of January 2026, 6pm.

## The challenge

The challenge will be about text simplification. Details follow soon.
